Assessing the Feasibility and Environmental Impact of Replacing Coal Power Plants with Nuclear Energy in India

Project Description
This project evaluates the feasibility, environmental, and socio-economic impacts of transitioning from coal-based power generation to nuclear energy in India. The analysis involves cost-benefit evaluations, regional economic effects, emission reductions, and energy production reliability. Using simulations and models based on validated data from government and international sources, the study provides actionable insights for a sustainable energy transition.

Key Objectives
Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):

Compare the Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for coal and nuclear power.
Run Monte Carlo simulations to account for uncertainties in cost and revenue projections.
Environmental Impact Simulation:

Quantify reductions in CO₂, SO₂, and PM emissions under coal-to-nuclear replacement scenarios.
Assess health cost savings from improved air quality.
Regional Economic Effects Simulation:

Analyze employment impacts (job losses and creation) and GDP changes for various regions in India.
Energy Production Modeling:

Simulate long-term energy production reliability for coal and nuclear power plants.
Policy Recommendations:

Propose actionable strategies such as carbon taxes, nuclear subsidies, and workforce retraining programs.
